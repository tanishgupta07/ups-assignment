2-4 Restatements of information
In the 2024 GHG inventory, new emission factors resulted in an immaterial impact on scope 1 and 2
emissions, and reduced scope 3 emissions by 24%. A recalculation of scope 3 emissions for both the
base year (2020) and previous year (2023) was done to provide for consistent year-over-year emissions

brokerage business ("Coyote") to allow an even greater focus on our core business.

suppliers. Supply chain partners can be broadly grouped into three categories:
• Production Suppliers represent the majority of our total procurement spending. They provide
purchased transportation services and energy to operate our global logistics network. At the
region and country levels, we contract with transportation service suppliers, such as airlines,
trucking companies, railroads and ocean carriers, as well as fuel suppliers. We also contract with
third-party representatives that provide domestic delivery services in certain countries and
territories.
• Capacity Suppliers provide equipment and facilities that we use in our operations. This includes
suppliers of strategic assets, such as jet aircraft, major facilities, and alternative fuel or advanced
technology vehicles. We work with original equipment manufacturers to design and develop our
ground and air fleets in a way that seeks to reduce their environmental impact.

technology vehicles. We work with original equipment manufacturers to design and develop our
ground and air fleets in a way that seeks to reduce their environmental impact.
• Support Suppliers provide standardized products and services that support our business, such as
marketing, advertising, human resources, shipping materials and other professional services.
In the first quarter of 2025, as previously disclosed, we entered into an agreement in principle with our
largest customer to significantly reduce the volume we deliver for them. We expect volume from this
customer to decline to approximately 50% of year-end 2024 levels by mid-2026.
In conjunction therewith, as disclosed on January 30, 2025, we are beginning a network reconfiguration
within the U.S. which is expected to lead to consolidations of our facilities and workforce as well as an
end-to-end process redesign through 2027.

This network reconfiguration, which is an expansion of our Network of the Future program, is expected
to result in exit activities that could result in the closure of up to 10% of our buildings in 2025, a
reduction in the size of our vehicle and aircraft fleets, and a decrease in the size of our workforce. We
are not yet able to determine the specific assets or extent of our workforce that will be impacted by this
network reconfiguration, the timing of those changes or any associated charges and expenses. We
expect that impacted assets will remain in use during some or all of the periods of our network
reconfiguration.

2-15 Conflict of interest
The UPS Code of Business Conduct ➯ (the "Code") and the Company's Related Persons Transaction
Policy ➯, which are available on its investor relations website, set out its processes and policies for
avoiding or managing conflicts of interest.
The Company's Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing compliance with the Code. The Code
requires employees and directors to avoid conflicts of interest, defined as situations where the person's
private interests conflict, or may appear to conflict, with the interests of UPS.

============================================================
requires employees and directors to avoid conflicts of interest, defined as situations where the person's
private interests conflict, or may appear to conflict, with the interests of UPS.
UPS also maintains a related person transactions policy that applies to any transaction or series of
transactions in which: (1) the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant; (2) any “related
person” (as defined therein) has or will have a material direct or indirect interest; and (3) the aggregate
amount involved since the beginning of the Company's last completed fiscal year will exceed or may
reasonably be expected to exceed $100,000.
The policy provides that related person transactions that may arise during the year are subject to the
Audit Committee's reasonable prior approval. In determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction,
the Audit Committee considers, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the transaction is

============================================================
the Audit Committee considers, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the transaction is
on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same
or similar circumstance, the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction, whether the
transaction would impair independence of a non-employee director and whether there is a business
reason for the Company to enter into the transaction. The Company did not engage in any related
person transactions in 2024 that required disclosure or Audit Committee approval.
At least annually, each director and executive officer completes a questionnaire in which they are
required to disclose any business relationships that may give rise to a conflict of interest, including
transactions where the Company is involved and where an executive officer, a director or a related
person has a direct or indirect material interest. We also review the Company's financial systems and

any identified related party transactions are reviewed for potential conflicts of interest. All transactions

independence.

2-25 Processes to remediate negative impacts
See the UPS Code of Business Conduct ➯ "Reporting Concerns, Asking Questions and Voicing Opinions."
Throughout its global operations, the Company works with many unions, associations, and work
councils. UPS agreements with U.S. labor organizations have specific provisions regarding the methods
for resolving grievances. These provisions mandate periodic meetings of union and company
representatives, with an escalation framework if the parties cannot agree on a resolution.

reporting period.
From time to time, we are involved in judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of
our business. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome, we have generally denied,
or believe we have meritorious defenses and will deny liability in all pending matters, including the
matters described in Note 10 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we intend to vigorously defend
each matter. We accrue amounts associated with judicial proceedings and other contingencies when
and to the extent a loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we
record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses; however,
when there appears to be a range of equally possible losses, our accrual is at the low end of this range.

============================================================
The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and
determining a reasonable estimate of the loss or a range of potential losses may not be practicable
based on the information available. Additionally, events may arise that were not anticipated and, as a
result, the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss that differs materially from our previously
estimated liability.
For matters as to which we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of losses, we are not able to
determine whether any such loss will have a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
For these matters, we have described the reasons that we are unable to estimate a possible loss or
range of losses in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (Note 10).

Community Impact of Operations
More than half of the world's population lives in cities, with the share of urban dwellers expected to
increase. This growth is expected to contribute to the challenges of emissions pollution and congestion,
caused not only by the increasing number of residents but also by e-commerce activity and evolving
business models. UPS continues to collaborate with various city partners and other stakeholders to
develop and test innovative delivery solutions in dense urban areas. These include electric vehicles and a
range of bicycle- and tricycle-based delivery solutions, all of which operate with zero emissions. We have
found that pedal-powered vehicles can be well-suited for making multiple deliveries in dense urban
areas as they are more maneuverable than package cars and may access routes that other vehicles
cannot, such as bicycle lanes and narrow city streets.

Our Purpose & Our Mission
UPS is guided by a clear purpose to move our world forward by delivering what matters. We execute this
purpose through our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy across the enterprise.
Evidence indicates that human activities that result in the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
are contributing to a warming of the planet. This can have a wide range of impacts such as changes in
local weather patterns, an increase of extreme weather events, and an increase in sea levels, which
threaten both human societies and natural ecosystems. According to the International Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), the transportation sector accounts for ~15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In an

Our Strategy
To execute on our decarbonization transition plans, we have established strategic focus areas for our
organization:
Efficiency and Innovation
Efficiency and innovation are core to UPS’s business model. UPS engineers are continuously optimizing
operations and operational flows based on real-time factors including volume levels, asset availability,
weather conditions, service commitments and other considerations. We design, develop, implement and
leverage digital and physical technology to reduce distance traveled, increase utilization of assets and to
lower the energy intensity required to make the movements happen within our network, thereby
lowering the absolute emissions and carbon intensity of UPS’s operations.

Asset Transition
UPS uses a variety of assets to provide transportation and logistics services across the enterprise,
including vehicles, aircraft and facilities. UPS leverages a rolling laboratory approach to identify asset
types that can meet the safety, service, financial and sustainability requirements of the business. Once
identified, tested and validated, these asset types are scaled in various business units and geographies.
The purchasing of new assets is facilitated within the Company's capital expenditure process. The
Company publicly discloses the amount of annual capital expenditures associated with environmental
sustainability goals. The amounts can include, but are not limited to, the purchase of new, more fuel
efficient aircraft, zero tailpipe emission aircraft and vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, infrastructure to
support the deployment of low emission projects and facility projects that lower energy consumption.

Renewable Electricity
UPS consumes electricity and runs equipment in both its operational and non-operational facilities. The
Company also leverages a suite of instruments to increase renewable electricity usage, including on-site
solar projects, retail supply contracts, power purchase agreements, and unbundled renewable energy
certificates ("RECs").
UPS continuously evaluates existing and new instruments, and executes agreements based on the best-
fit projects, leveraging evaluation criteria, including financial performance, operational performance and
sustainability quality. Approval for these projects is managed within the Company’s capital lifecycle
management processes.

the future. Further, we expect the underlying electricity grids to transition to a higher percentage of
renewable electricity over time through efforts undertaken by the utility companies managing the grids
both today and in the future.
Carbon Offsets
UPS's strategy is to decarbonize our own operations first, and we do not intend to use carbon offsets as
a GHG reduction mechanism in the near term unless required through regulations or laws. We will
continue to assess the need for carbon offsets as part of our decarbonization efforts and will consider
several factors including: quality, additionality, permanence and options for eliminating residual and/or
hard to abate emissions. We have and expect to continue to offer voluntary carbon offset products to
customers.

Public Policy Advocacy
Public policy plays a vital role in creating a fair and even playing field for UPS and other businesses that
are committed to reducing their environmental impact and meeting their sustainability goals. UPS
advocates for a technology agnostic approach to innovation that does not predetermine winners and
losers before technological and commercial viability can be assessed. We support policies that
incentivize the production and use of renewable and biofuels, such as tax credits, grants, mandates and
standards, as well as policies that enable the deployment of low and zero emission vehicles and
infrastructure, such as rebates, vouchers and funding programs. We participate in public policy forums

Executing Our Strategy
Decarbonizing Ground Operations (Scope 1 & 2)
UPS is one of the largest fleet owner-operators in the world, with approximately 128,000 heavy, medium
and small duty vehicles in the fleet. UPS has established four strategic focus areas to transition UPS
ground operations to a low-carbon future: (1) invest in hardware and software technologies that reduce
fuel and energy usage within UPS operations, (2) transition the assets in the fleet to zero emission and
vehicles that can consume commercially available low carbon fuels, (3) expand the use of low emission

============================================================
vehicles that can consume commercially available low carbon fuels, (3) expand the use of low emission
fuels such as renewable natural gas and renewable diesel, and (4) maximize the utilization of zero and
low emission vehicles.
Decarbonizing Air Operations (Scope 1 & 2)
UPS has one of the largest aircraft fleets in the world, with 291 aircraft owned by the Company, and 243
aircraft leased or chartered by the company. And the UPS air operations generate the largest portion of
scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas at the company through the consumption of jet fuel. To transition UPS air
operations to a low-carbon future, the company has established three strategic focus areas: (1) reduce
fuel usage through the use of advance technology and other operating efficiencies (2) transition the fleet
to more fuel efficient aircraft, and (3) expand the usage of low-emission Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Challenges We Continue to Address
Renewable and Biofuel Supply and Cost
UPS requires renewable and biofuels to be available at scale, and with a competitive cost profile
compared to conventional fuel sources, to meet our decarbonization goals. SAF is critical to
decarbonizing our air operations, which drives a significant amount of UPS’s overall emissions. Currently,
SAF supply is limited and cost prohibitive compared to conventional jet fuel. We depend on
technological advancements, economies of scale, geographical availability and public policy
developments that are outside of our control to make these fuels broadly and economically available.
Public Policy
Fragmented public policy within the markets we serve can create challenges, including insufficient
infrastructure support, undefined and inconsistent policy positions and lack of financial support for clean
energy projects. Additionally, local laws and regulations may not reflect a holistic approach across the

energy projects. Additionally, local laws and regulations may not reflect a holistic approach across the
value chain to ensure that market demand, market supply, and the infrastructure necessary to enable
market participants to meet their goals are all aligned. The absence of unified policy approaches may
challenge UPS’s ability to drive material carbon emission reductions in a cost-effective manner.
Competitive Landscape
Our industry continues to rapidly evolve, including demands for faster deliveries, increased shipment
visibility and development of other services. We expect to continue to face significant competition on a
local, regional, national and international basis. Competitors include the U.S. and international postal
services, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers, and large

Goals & Progress
We have defined interim goals for 2025 and 2035 to demonstrate progress towards our overarching goal
of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We are committed to providing updates on our progress towards
achieving our goals. UPS's decarbonization transition plans enabled the Company to make progress
during 2024 towards achieving our sustainability goals. In 2024, UPS's total gross scope 1, 2 and 3 CO2e

Goals: Renewable Electricity Powering Our Facilities
25% Renewable by 2025
Progress: In 2024, 15.2% of our total electricity for owned and leased facilities was generated from
renewable sources, compared to 10.9% in 2023.
UPS continues to evaluate and deploy new onsite solar and battery solutions globally. In 2024, UPS
entered into renewable electricity agreement to provide wind power from the Sweetwater 1 Wind Farm
in Nolan County, Texas to UPS's Texas facilities. This agreement provides UPS with 98,095 MWh of
renewable electricity per year. Additionally in 2024, UPS completed the construction of a pilot microgrid
project in Visalia, California. This demonstration facility has 2.49 MW of solar on the rooftop, and a 4.3
MWh battery system for battery back-up.
Both of UPS's U.S. data centers procured 100% renewable energy in 2024 through the purchase of

============================================================
Both of UPS's U.S. data centers procured 100% renewable energy in 2024 through the purchase of
unbundled renewable energy credits (RECs). This is the third consecutive year the Company has
purchased renewable energy for its U.S. data centers. All unbundled RECs that UPS purchased in 2024
complied with the following procurement policies: Green-e Certified; RECs came from a renewable
resource that had a commercial operation date within the last four years (2021 or after); the REC was
produced within calendar year 2024; REC procurement was matched regionally to the location of the
load; and REC purchases that included community or social impact were prioritized.
100% Renewable by 2035
Progress: In addition to the above, in 2024 UPS entered into two long-term renewable electricity
contracts for new assets, which will come online in future years: (1) Pivot Energy will convert most of
our electricity use in Colorado to solar energy by using two new solar facilities. This is expected to

increase renewable electricity usage by up to 1%; and (2) New York Community Solar program, which
includes Green-e certified replacement RECs in an equal amount to our subscription. This program
supports the local community by building local renewable energy assets and offering utility bill discounts
to community members.
Goal: 40% Alternative Fuels Used in UPS Ground Operations by 2025*
*Fuel in ground operations is defined as all fuel used in on-highway and facility-based vehicles for
mobile ground operations. This includes our tractor-trailers, package cars, ground support equipment
for loading/unloading aircraft, forklifts in our facilities and shifters for moving trailers. Alternative fuels
are any fuels other than conventional gasoline and diesel, including compressed natural gas ("CNG"),

============================================================
are any fuels other than conventional gasoline and diesel, including compressed natural gas ("CNG"),
liquified natural gas ("LNG"), propane, biodiesel, renewable diesel, ethanol and renewable natural gas
("RNG").
Progress: In 2024, we purchased 177 million gallons of alternative fuel, which represented 30.6% of our
total ground fuel usage, an increase of 180 basis points above the 2023 results of 28.8%. In 2024, UPS
contracted for the purchase of over 1,700 CNG and LNG heavy duty vehicles for deployment in 2024 and
2025. As a result of adding and retiring vehicles, UPS's alternative fuel and advanced technology fleet
expanded to over 19,000 vehicles. The Company also increased its usage of RNG, supporting the
environmentally friendly principles of a circular economy. In 2024, RNG as a percentage of total natural
gas increased to 87% compared to 70% in 2023, an increase of 29 million gallons. In addition, UPS

Goal: 30% Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Our Air Network by 2035
Progress: Our SAF purchases were minimal in 2024 and are therefore not included in the 2024 emissions
and energy calculations.
UPS is purchasing SAF in the European mandatory markets. The Company engages with fuel suppliers,
government agencies and research institutions to understand and advocate for public policy measures
that support the production of SAF at scale and fair playing field between SAF technology pathways and
feedstock inputs.
To reduce fuel consumption in the near term, UPS has ordered twenty-five new aircraft that offer
significant fuel efficiencies over previous generations of aircraft within the same class of aircraft. We are
exploring the usage of electric and hydrogen aircraft in our operations, including through investments in
technologies such as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.

============================================================
exploring the usage of electric and hydrogen aircraft in our operations, including through investments in
technologies such as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.
The Company is also executing several initiatives that reduce fuel burn. These include reduced usage of
aircraft auxiliary power units (APUs), transitioning to electric ground support equipment, optimizing
flight routes and using data analytics to reduce arrival fuel requirements, leveraging AI tools to optimize
aircraft climb profiles in real time, in-flight wind uploads for long haul flights to aid in optimum altitude
selection and continuous training and feedback on best fuel practices. We estimate that these initiatives
reduced jet fuel consumption by approximately 30 million in 2024.
We continuously assess our flight requirements to determine the optimal number of block hours
required to meet service commitments and maximize the payload capacity of our aircraft. While the

============================================================
We continuously assess our flight requirements to determine the optimal number of block hours
required to meet service commitments and maximize the payload capacity of our aircraft. While the
above initiatives have positive impacts on the carbon emissions of our air operations, we believe using
SAF at scale remains the primary way to decarbonize the aviation industry.
Goal: 50% Reduction in CO2e per Global Small Package by 2035 (2020 baseline)*
*Measures total scope 1 and 2 emissions for our global operations. We use a carbon dioxide equivalent
(CO2e) calculation which sums equivalent values of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous
oxide (N2O).
Progress: Our carbon intensity per package decreased in 2024 by 1.1% compared to 2023 but increased
by 5.5% compared to the 2020 baseline.
The year over year combined CO2e/package for ground, facility heat, and electricity decreased by 0.091

============================================================
by 5.5% compared to the 2020 baseline.
The year over year combined CO2e/package for ground, facility heat, and electricity decreased by 0.091
and offset air CO2e/package of 0.059. As a result, total scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions per package
decreased by 0.032, or 1.1%. Total consolidated volume in 2024 increased by 0.2% compared to 2023. A
full breakdown of UPS emissions by category can be found in the table “CO2e by Fuel Type” within
Appendix B. To calculate emissions per package, UPS divides the total scope 1 and 2 emissions in CO2e
(using the fuel type split in Appendix B) by the total package volume.
Across all sustainability goals, we expect variability in our interim progress as the Company executes its
strategy and adjusts to external factors, including shifting customer preferences, governmental policies,
competitive dynamics and evolving technology.

401-2 Benefits provided to full-time employees that are not provided to temporary or part-
time employees
UPS provides healthcare benefits for many employees, retirees and their dependents through plans
administered to meet the health and wellness needs of various employee groups. In addition, we make
contributions on behalf of UPS employees and their eligible dependents who are covered by union-
administered plans.
While there are variations in available plans, the following is an example of typical benefits offered to
UPS non-union employees in the U.S. Generally, full-time and part-time employees are offered the same
types of benefits unless otherwise noted below. We do not offer temporary employees benefits.

• Dental care
• Vision care
• Life insurance
• Supplemental life insurance

requirements.
We further invest in our people by offering a competitive range of other benefits, such as paid time off,
retirement plans and tuition assistance, in addition to those for health and wellness. In the U.S., these
other benefits are generally provided to non-union employees without regard to full-time or part-time
status. Some benefits may, in practical terms, apply only to management employees, such as relocation
programs.
Our union employees bargain collectively and benefits are determined based on the union contracts and
via their union representatives. For example, temporary and seasonal union workers are generally
ineligible for UPS benefits.
In 2025, we plan to implement family planning services and specialized caregiving assistance to the
benefits offered to non-union employees. In 2024 we expanded Patch, our emergency/back-up childcare

Our certified occupational health professionals are aligned into four strategic verticals (Compliance,
Medical Care, Mental Health and Total Health) to address the overall health of our workforce. Specific
priorities include psychological, first aid training, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, sleep/fatigue and
ergonomic risk factors.
403-7 Prevention and mitigation of occupational health and safety impacts directly linked by
business relationships
UPS conducts audits to assess specific risks, including equipment safety, workplace environment and
emergency response protocols. These audits are part of a collaborative framework that also involves our
contractors, agents and outside service providers. Together, we share lessons learned and best
practices, which span topics including incident reporting, hazard identification and risk assessment.
These collaborative efforts have helped reduce workplace injuries and vehicle crashes and have fostered
a culture of safety.

assess these standards, we implemented a Safety System Assessment approach with four primary
objectives:
• Assess and build the safety capability of the responsible facility management and safety
management to implement both management systems and technical standards
• Assess and build the capability of the responsible facility management and safety management
to implement corrective action plans to improve performance
• Identify opportunity for improvement of safety processes and standards
• Examine critical areas of health and safety to the organization
The Safety System Assessments measure the conformance to each applicable standard for the facility
and management team using the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle which is an iterative design and management
method used in business for the control and continual improvement of processes and products. It is also
known as the Shewhart cycle, or the control circle/cycle.

our GHG Emissions reporting rests with our Chief Sustainability Officer.
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions information is prepared in accordance with the World Resources Institute
(WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition).
Scope 3 GHG emissions information is prepared in accordance with the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas
Protocol: Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3), Accounting and Reporting Standard.
Collectively, the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) and the Corporate
Value Chain (Scope 3), Accounting and Reporting Standard are referred to as the “GHG Protocol” in this
document. The following includes information on GHG emissions by business unit and emission source,
as well as intensity disclosures.

Base year GHG emissions
The base year GHG emissions for scope 1, 2, and 3 is 2020.
UPS will change the base year as needed to properly track progress against current sustainability goals.
The GHG Protocol states, “Selection and recalculation of a base year should relate to the business goals
and the particular context of the company: For the purpose of reporting progress towards voluntary
public GHG targets, companies may follow the standards and guidance in this chapter.” Should new
emissions-related sustainability goals be published with a new base year, the base year for the
greenhouse gas inventory will be changed to reflect the new goal base year for consistency with the
Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

In addition, the science-based targets initiative suggests, “It is recommended that companies use the
same base years for all near term targets.” Although UPS does not currently have a science-based target,
UPS recognizes SBTi's leadership in the space and feels that its suggestion for a consistent base year is
appropriate for consideration. Using two base years in the inventory and/or goals does not align with
this recommendation from SBTi and UPS will only use the base year from the most recently updated
goals for consistency. The most recent goals have a base year of 2020, which will be used as the base
year until new goals are created or warranted.
Greenhouse gases
GHG emissions figures are reported in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO e) and include

The GHG Protocol defines global warming potential (GWP) as “a factor describing the radiative forcing
impact (degree of harm to the atmosphere) of one unit of a given GHG relative to one unit of CO ." By

using GWPs, GHG emissions from multiple gases can be standardized to a carbon dioxide equivalent

GHG emission factors
The carbon dioxide equivalent emissions associated with the activities described in the detailed
description of our operational boundaries were determined on the basis of measured or estimated
energy and fuel use, multiplied by relevant carbon emission factors. Published emission factors were
used to calculate emissions from operations. Renewable electricity use is supported through energy
attribute certificates and supplier contracts.
GHG emission factors by source
After a review of the applicable emission factors available, updates were made to certain emission
factors used to compute scopes 1 and 3. The impact to scope 1 was immaterial, however the impact to
scope 3 prompted a recalculation of our base year (2020) and prior year (2023).

associated emissions through the application of the GHG emission factors described above. GHG
emission calculations for scope 3 use various sources of secondary data since primary data is
unavailable. The secondary data used varies from miles driven, number of packages picked up/delivered
to estimated shipment information (weight and distance per shipment). The appropriate GHG factor is
applied to estimate the emissions reported.

Carbon offset purchases from UPS carbon neutral product
A carbon offset is a certified financial instrument aimed at a reduction in GHG emissions. The offsets we
purchase meet the key standard of additionality, which means that the carbon reduction project in
question (such as reforestation) produced a reduction in CO e generation or sequestration of CO e in
2 2
addition to what would have been achieved by activities already planned or underway. UPS is currently
not using these offsets to meet our GHG goals. They are purchased and retired on behalf of our
customers that are electing to offset the GHG emissions associated with the shipment of their packages
and freight. The credits are certified through standards shown in the "Offset Standard" column. The
table below is a summary of carbon offsets purchased on behalf of our customers.
